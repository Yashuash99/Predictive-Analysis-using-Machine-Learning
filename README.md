TASK DESCRIPTION: The Mushroom Classifier is a supervised machine learning project developed to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on a range of categorical physical attributes. This classification task utilizes the UCI Mushroom Dataset, which contains information such as cap shape, color, odor, gill size, and other morphological features. The main objective was to build a robust classifier that can accurately differentiate between edible and poisonous mushrooms using these features. The project was developed entirely in Python using VS Code as the primary IDE, taking advantage of its intelligent debugging, code completion, integrated terminal, and extensions like Python, GitLens, and Jupyter for smooth development. The project involves key stages such as data loading using pandas, preprocessing using LabelEncoder to handle categorical values, and model training using multiple algorithms from scikit-learn, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression. Performance of the models was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and confusion matrices were plotted for better interpretability. The Random Forest model was selected as the best performing classifier due to its high accuracy and generalization ability. The selected model was serialized and saved using joblib for future predictions and deployment.

The folder structure is organized into subdirectories for clarity: a data/ folder containing the dataset, a models/ folder holding the trained model files, a mushroom_classifier.py script that integrates all functionalities from preprocessing to evaluation, and a requirements.txt file listing the dependencies used in the project. It also reflects a real-world scenario where machine learning models can assist in making quick and reliable decisions with limited input data. This task helped reinforce the importance of data preprocessing, the impact of choosing the right algorithm, and the role of visualization in model interpretation, making it a well-rounded and insightful learning experience.
